-- QUESTION : 1
-- 1. You have a table called "website_traffic" with columns "date", "page_views", and "unique_visitors". 
-- Write a query to find the days where the page views increased by more than 20% compared to the previous day, 
-- and the unique visitors also increased by more than 15% compared to the previous day.

drop table if exists website_traffic;
CREATE TABLE website_traffic (
    date DATE,
    page_views INT,
    unique_visitors INT
);

-- Insert 30 rows of modified sample data
INSERT INTO website_traffic (date, page_views, unique_visitors) VALUES
('2024-10-01', 100, 80),
('2024-10-02', 125, 95),  -- 25% increase in page_views, 18.75% in unique_visitors
('2024-10-03', 110, 88),
('2024-10-04', 130, 95),
('2024-10-05', 160, 110), -- 23.1% increase in page_views, 15.8% in unique_visitors
('2024-10-06', 140, 100),
('2024-10-07', 175, 120), -- 25% increase in page_views, 20% in unique_visitors
('2024-10-08', 150, 105),
('2024-10-09', 180, 125), -- 20% increase in page_views, 19% in unique_visitors
('2024-10-10', 200, 140), -- 11.1% increase in page_views, 12% increase in unique_visitors (not meeting conditions)
('2024-10-11', 250, 170), -- 25% increase in page_views, 21.4% in unique_visitors
('2024-10-12', 205, 135);

-- QUESTION : 2
-- 2. Write a SQL query to retrieve the managers who oversee at least five employees within the same department, along with the department name and the total number of direct reports, 
-- but only if the department has more than ten employees in total.

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    managerId INT
