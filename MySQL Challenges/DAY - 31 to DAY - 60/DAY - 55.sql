-- QUESTION : 1
-- 1. In a Football tournament, some data is recorded. Every winning team gets a point and the losing team loses a point.
-- At the end of the tournament, a ranking is given to all the teams based on their total points. 
-- The total points of a team can go be negative. You are given tables: matches_record and team_details.

-- The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:
-- The total points should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
-- If two teams have the same total points, then the team with the higher number of winning goals would be ranked higher.

-- Task:
-- Write a query to find the rank of all the teams.

CREATE TABLE matches_record (
    match_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    winning_team_id INT,
    losing_team_id INT,
    winning_goals INT,
    losing_goals INT
);

CREATE TABLE team_details (
    team_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    team_name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO team_details (team_id, team_name) VALUES
(1, 'Philippines Pirates'),
(2, 'Nickmiesters'),
(3, 'Smashers'),
(4, 'Sunrisers');

INSERT INTO matches_record (match_id, winning_team_id, losing_team_id, winning_goals, losing_goals) VALUES
(1, 1, 2, 3, 1),
(2, 3, 4, 2, 0),
(3, 1, 4, 4, 2),
(4, 2, 3, 2, 1),
(5, 1, 3, 1, 0);

-- QUESTION : 2
-- 2. Train destinations
-- You are given data on different types of trains and their departure and destination stations in the given database.

-- Task:
-- Write an SQL query to find the names and types of trains that I have destinations in Pennsylvania or Chicago. 
-- Sort the final output by train_name.

CREATE TABLE trains (
    train_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    train_name VARCHAR(255),
    type_name VARCHAR(255),
    departure_station VARCHAR(255),
    destination_station VARCHAR(255)

INSERT INTO trains (train_id, train_name, type_name, departure_station, destination_station) 
VALUES 
(1, 'Abraham Lincoln', 'Express', 'New York', 'Pennsylvania'),
(2, 'Advance Flyer', 'Express', 'Boston', 'Chicago'),
